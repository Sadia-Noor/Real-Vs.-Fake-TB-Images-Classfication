# Real-Vs.-Fake-TB-Images-Classfication
This project explores tuberculosis (TB) detection using advanced techniques like data augmentation and Autoencoder-generated synthetic images. Leveraging chest X-ray (CXR) data from the NIAID TB dataset, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and VGG16 models were trained to classify real vs. synthetic TB images. The CNN model achieved a promising test accuracy of 79%, later improved to 96% through hyperparameter tuning. This research highlights the potential of machine learning in healthcare for early TB detection and emphasizes the importance of refining model architectures and dataset diversity for enhanced diagnostic accuracy.
